# Python_Notes
Variables:
Variables are an essential part of Python and any programming language. A variable is a name that references or points to an object. You can declare a variable by writing the variable name on the left side of the assignment operator = and specifying the value to assign to that variable on the right side of the assignment operator.

Variables can store values of different data types. You just assigned an integer value, but if you want to represent some text, you need to assign a string. Strings are sequences of characters enclosed by single or double quotes, but you cannot start a string with a single quote and end it with a double quote or vice versa.

Key aspects of variable naming in Python are:
Some words are reserved keywords (e.g. for, while, True). They have a special meaning in Python, so you cannot use them for variable names.
Variable names cannot start with a number, and they can only contain alpha-numeric characters or underscores.
Variable names are case sensitive, i.e. my_var is different from my_Var and MY_VAR.
Finally, it is a common convention to write variable names using snake_case, where each space is replaced by an underscore character and the words are written in lowercase letters.

Functions: 
You can use the built-in function print() to print the output of your code on the terminal.
Functions are reusable code blocks that you can call, or invoke, to run their code when you need them. To call a function, you just need to write a pair of parentheses next to its name. You will learn more about functions very soon.

Argument:
An argument is an object or an expression passed to a function — added between the opening and closing parentheses — when it is called.
