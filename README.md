# Python_Notes
Variables:
Variables are an essential part of Python and any programming language. A variable is a name that references or points to an object. You can declare a variable by writing the variable name on the left side of the assignment operator = and specifying the value to assign to that variable on the right side of the assignment operator.

Variables can store values of different data types. You just assigned an integer value, but if you want to represent some text, you need to assign a string. Strings are sequences of characters enclosed by single or double quotes, but you cannot start a string with a single quote and end it with a double quote or vice versa.

Key aspects of variable naming in Python are:
Some words are reserved keywords (e.g. for, while, True). They have a special meaning in Python, so you cannot use them for variable names.
Variable names cannot start with a number, and they can only contain alpha-numeric characters or underscores.
Variable names are case sensitive, i.e. my_var is different from my_Var and MY_VAR.
Finally, it is a common convention to write variable names using snake_case, where each space is replaced by an underscore character and the words are written in lowercase letters.

Functions: 
You can use the built-in function print() to print the output of your code on the terminal.
Functions are reusable code blocks that you can call, or invoke, to run their code when you need them. To call a function, you just need to write a pair of parentheses next to its name. You will learn more about functions very soon.

Argument:
An argument is an object or an expression passed to a function — added between the opening and closing parentheses — when it is called.

Indentation:
Python relies on indentation to indicate blocks of code. A colon at the end of a line is a signal that a new indented block of code will follow. So, when no indented block is found after the final colon, the code execution stops and an IndentationError is thrown

Data Structure:
In Python, data structures allow for the storage of a list of values in a single variable. The first data structure we learn about is a list, which can contain any data type, including a list within a list. The length of a list can be determined using the length function.

Tuples:
Tuples are similar to lists, except they cannot be modified once declared. They are useful when you need to store large amounts of data more efficiently in memory, like X Y coordinate pairs.

Dictionary
a dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs, similar to a word and its definition in a book. Dictionaries are declared using curly braces and accessed using keys.

Operators
Operators are instructions that perform operations on variables and values in Python. They are used to manipulate and perform actions on data. The most familiar type of operator is the arithmetic operator, which is used for mathematical calculations. 

Comparison Operators
Comparison operators, logical operators, identity operators, and membership operators are another set of operators in Python. Comparison operators evaluate two variables or values and produce a Boolean result, either true or false. Examples include the double equal sign for equality, less-than, less-than or equal to, greater than, and greater than or equal to.

Logical Operators
Logical operators, such as "and," "or," and "not," operate on Boolean values. The "and" operator returns true only if both operands are true, while the "or" operator returns true if at least one operand is true. The "not" operator negates the Boolean value it operates on.

Membership Operators
Membership operators, "in" and "not in," are used to check whether a value is present in a sequence or not. For instance, using "in" can check if a number or a string exists in a given list or string.
